- 👋 Hi, I’m @MessyConcept
- 👀 I’m interested in: Learning to code so I can hopefull make a game one day! For now, I'll work on making websites though :)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: Python, and hopefully C++ soon!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: Nothing at the moment but hmu if you want to talk about something like that! (Disclaimer: I am very bad right now lol)
- 📫 How to reach me: Good question! I tend to pick up and leave as often as I settle down leaving behind only ruin, sort of like a socrched-earth tactic. However, if you desperately need to talk to me, my Discord is @messyconcept (who woulda thought)
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I started my coding journey about two weeks ago in March of 2024!
